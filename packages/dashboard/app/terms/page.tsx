        These Terms of Service (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) govern your use of the
        hosted MergeWatch SaaS available at{" "}
        <a href="https://mergewatch.ai">mergewatch.ai</a> (the

      <h2>1. Acceptance</h2>
      <p>
        By installing the MergeWatch GitHub App or signing in to the hosted

      <h2>2. The Service</h2>
      <p>
        MergeWatch reviews pull requests in repositories where you have
        installed the GitHub App, using large language models to produce
        comments and summaries. The Service is provided as-is and may be
        updated, suspended, or discontinued at any time. We do not guarantee
        that AI-generated reviews will catch all issues or be free of false
        positives. <strong>You remain responsible for the code you merge.</strong>
      </p>

      <h2>3. Your Responsibilities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You must have the authority to install MergeWatch on the repositories you connect.</li>
        <li>You must not use the Service to process code you are not permitted to share with third-party LLM providers (Amazon Bedrock).</li>
        <li>You must not attempt to reverse-engineer, disrupt, or abuse the Service, or use it to generate content that violates applicable law.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for keeping your GitHub account secure.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Billing and Plans</h2>
      <p>
        Paid plans are billed according to the pricing published at{" "}

        periods except where required by law.
