      <p>
        MergeWatch is an open-source GitHub App that reviews pull requests
        using a multi-agent AI pipeline. It was built to answer a simple
        question: <em>why should the tool that reviews your code cost more as
        your team grows, run on infrastructure you can&rsquo;t see, and lock you
        into a model you didn&rsquo;t choose?</em>
      </p>

      <h2>What it does</h2>
      <p>
        Every pull request triggers a parallel pipeline of specialized agents
        &mdash; security, bugs, style, summary, architectural impact &mdash;
        plus any custom agents you define in <code>.mergewatch.yml</code>. The
        orchestrator deduplicates findings, ranks them by severity and
        confidence, and posts a single upsert-style comment on the PR. Most
        reviews complete in under 60 seconds.
      </p>

      <h2>Two ways to run it</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Self-hosted (free, AGPL v3).</strong> One{" "}
          <code>docker-compose up</code>. Bring your own LLM provider &mdash;
          Anthropic direct, Amazon Bedrock, any OpenAI-compatible endpoint via
          LiteLLM (100+ providers), or Ollama for air-gapped environments.
          Your code never leaves your infrastructure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Managed SaaS.</strong> Install the GitHub App and go. Runs on
          Claude via Amazon Bedrock with IAM-native auth &mdash; no API keys to
          manage. Priced by pull request volume, not per seat, so hiring
          doesn&rsquo;t make your bill bigger.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why open source</h2>
      <p>
        Code review tools read every line your team writes. Closing the source
        on that is the wrong trade-off. MergeWatch ships under AGPL v3 &mdash;
        the full pipeline, every agent prompt, every orchestrator, every
        comment template is in the repo. Your security team can audit it.
        Your engineers can fork it. If we disappear tomorrow, your workflow
        keeps running.
